# ProtoOS
Protogen Operating System for Project Alpha Version 1 - only data files!

## A small introduction to how this repository is used:
This branch contains all the data files for starting your first Proto! It's a collection mainly for myself to organize my code and data on a central space where other people can watch my collection grow. 
Additionally I'd like everyone to get a starting point for their own project. So enjoy my stuff, but please don't redistribute it. This here contains hours over hours of work done by me and friends, so sharing is appreciated, but please be fair and keep it clean :)

## Working with the repo
### What you'll need for your Proto:
- a Raspberry Pi (3B tested)
- an SD Card (8+ GB) with Raspbian Desktop installed
- the [Adafruit RGB Matrix Bonnet](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3211) or the [Adafruit RGB Matrix HAT for Raspberry Pi](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2345)
- 2x 3mm (P3) 32x64px LED Matrix displays, for example [these ones](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2279)
- a power connector for your Raspberry Pi (usually not included)
- a 5V power supply for your Bonnet or HAT! This is not included and needs a 5,5mm/2,1mm barrel connector!
